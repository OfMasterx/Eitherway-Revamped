      question: 'What is Eitherway?',
      answer:
        'Eitherway is an AI-native development platform that turns plain ideas into fully working apps. From mobile and web to browser extensions and Web3 dApps, apps are created and deployed in minutes with a single prompt.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Do I need to know how to code?',
      answer:
        'No. Non-technical users can ship production-ready applications with just prompts. Developers can dive into the code at any time for full customization.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Where can I deploy my apps?',
      answer:
        'Apps built with Eitherway can be published to the App Store, Google Play, Chrome/Firefox extension stores, or deployed as web apps. Web3 apps can be deployed directly to Ethereum or other EVM-compatible networks.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How does Eitherway differ from no-code tools?',
      answer:
        'Traditional no-code platforms limit flexibility and lock you into proprietary builders. Eitherway operates in a real full-stack environment where AI installs packages, manages environments, and executes builds. You always own your code.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What about Web3 support?',
      answer:
        'Eitherway can generate smart contracts, integrate wallets, and deploy dApps with IPFS hosting. Itâ€™s designed to handle both Web2 and Web3 outputs in one workflow.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Is Eitherway secure?',
      answer:
        'Yes. Apps are built inside isolated WebContainers that sandbox execution. Dependencies are scanned for vulnerabilities, and store compliance checks are automated before publishing.',
    },
    {
      question: 'How does pricing work?',
      answer:
        'Eitherway will launch with a freemium model: free tier for basic builds, Pro subscriptions for unlimited builds and multi-platform deployments, and Enterprise plans with dedicated AI instances and on-premise options.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Will there be a marketplace?',
      answer:
        'Yes. Eitherway will feature a marketplace for templates, plugins, and UI kits. Developers, designers, and AI specialists can earn revenue by publishing their work, with transactions handled in EITHER tokens or credits.',
    },
    {
      question: 'What is the $EITHER token used for?',
      answer:
        'EITHER is the backbone of the ecosystem. It powers subscriptions, deployment credits, marketplace transactions, governance, and incentives for creators and stakers.',
